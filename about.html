<p></p><h1>About</h1><p></p><p> Flux  is  written  and  maintained  by  Ritchie  Turner.  I  provide     consultancy  and  programming  services  around  haXe,  Node.js  and  the  Flux     framework.    </p><p> I  have  experience  in  C,  Java,  Javascript,  Python  and  PHP.  Currently  i  am  studying     Erlang  as  inspiration  on  direction  for  Flux  and  OCaml  due  to  it's     intersection  with  haXe.  I  also  like  Lisps,  particularly  Clojure  (the  ideas  of     Rich  Hickey  are  fantastic),  and  I  do  automation  scripts  in  Newlisp  as  it's     small  and  portable.    </p><p> I'm  well  versed  in  'full  spectrum'  web  development  from  Linux  server  setup;     bash,  postgresql,  redis,  couchdb,  nginx  etc  to  client  tech  (dojo,  jquery  etc).    </p><p> I  prefer:    </p><p></p><ul><li> Linux  to  Windows <li> Emacs  to  IDEs <li> Static  to  dynamic  typing <li> Json  to  XML <li> Async  to  threads </ul><p> I  enjoy  writing  tools  and  looking  for  better  abstractions.  My  current  interests     lie  in  Bitcoin,  and  learning  and  applying  functional  paradigms/style  to  my     work.    </p><p> If  you  wish  to  use  my  services  i  charge  the  equivalent  of  2  ounces  of  gold  in     your  currency  per  month.  I  accept  partial  payment  in  Bitcoin.    </p><p> I  live  in  Santiago,  Chile,  with  my  wife  and  baby  daughter.    </p><p> Email:  ritchie  at  flux  dot  cl    </p><p></p><p></p><p> I  enjoy  writing  tools  and  looking  for  better  abstractions.
