<p></p><h1>Why haXe?</h1><p></p><p> As  javascript  projects  get  larger,  developers  need  to  manage  complexity;     traditionally,  the  first  tool  for  this  task  is  the  compiler.  The  haXe  compiler     generates  Javascript  (also  PHP,  C++,  SWF)  and  can  help  manage  complexity.    </p><p> haXe  is  a  great  fusion  of  strong/weak  typing,  oop/functional  styles,  and  has  a     super  fast  compiler.    </p><p></p><ul><li> Type  Inference <li> Classes,  interfaces,  typedefs  (multiple  defs  in  one  file) <li> Closures <li> Generics <li> Supercharged  enums  (OCaml  like  discriminated  unions) <li> Lambda  library <li> Full  reflection <li> Meta  Data <li> Macros <li> Easy  definition  of  type  signatures  for  external  libraries. </ul><p><a href="http://github.com/sagework/haXe_lang_ref/raw/master/haXe2_lang_ref_sep_24_2010.pdf">Language ref (pdf)</a> .    </p><p> It's  great  to  create  code  incrementally  in  a  dynamic  language,  in  my  experience     the  grief  is  in  refactoring.  A  typed  language  makes  refactoring  large  projects     much  easier  by  ensuring  all  variables/structures  correspond  everywhere.    </p><p> Switching  languages  and  marshalling  data  between  tiers  is  a  recipe  for  code     duplication  and  errors.  haXe  removes  this  friction  by  providing  typed  RPC,  and     the  ability  to  share  data  structures  between  tiers.    </p><p> haXe  can  build  all  tiers  incredibly  quickly  from  a  simple  but  effective  make     file,  and  you  can  be  sure  all  the  elements  of  your  system  are  in  sync.    </p><p> Remember  also  that  haXe  targets  PHP,  Flash  and  mobile  too.  That  means  that  your     team  can  continue  to  target  all  the  main  vehicles  of  web  development  from  one     language!    </p><p></p><h1>Why Node.js?</h1><p></p><p> Node.js  is  a  powerful  yet  lightweight  serverside  platform  for  Windows/Linux.  I     believe  it's  low  resource  utilisation  will  mean  we'll  find  it  everywhere  -     probably  supplanting  PHP  on  shared  hosts.    </p><p> Node.js  is  the  best  serverside  platform  available  for  haXe  and  can  be  used     instead  of  neko  in  most  situtations.  It's  particularly  suitable  for  high  traffic     sites  when  proxied  behind  another  web  server,  e.g.  nginx.    </p><p> Node.js  available  for  most  Unix  and  on  Windows  (Microsoft  supports  Node.js     development).    </p><p></p><ul><li> Industrial  Strength;  Google  V8,  Lars  Bak  (hotspot  compiler) <li> Fast;  Javascript  compiled  directly  to  machine  code. <li> Huge  mindshare,  Javascript  is  the  defacto  language  of  the  web <li> Small  Footprint,  great  for  shared  hosting  environments. <li> Simple,  minimalist  API. <li> All  asynchronous,  based  on  well  tested  libs. <li> Single  threaded,  removing  a  class  of  potential  bugs. <li> Node.js  is  the  best  and  most  robust  serverside  platform  for  haXe. <li> Liberally  licensed. </div>
