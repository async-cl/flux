* Cloudshift - A haXe Stack for Node.js

  See http://www.cloudshift.cl for full documentation.

  Cloudshift is written and maintained by Ritchie Turner (blackdog@cloudshift.cl)
  and is currently under heavy development; the apis are subject to change.
  

** Core Module

  Cloudshift provides a consistent set of tools on client and server for dealing
  with common problems;
  
  - *haXe remoting* for inter tier and sub-process communication
  - *Outcome<T>* (approximately a Future<Either<String,T>) as the means for
    dealing with async callback hell and error handling.
  - *Parts* are components which have an asynchronous new() in the start()
    method - start() returns an Outcome. Further they may be stopped
    asynchronously with stop(). Parts are also Observable.

** Http Module
   
   Simplest example ...

   Http.server()
   .root("/dir/to/serve")
   .start({host:"localhost",port:8080});

   and/or provide multiple handlers per url, e.g.

   Http.server().handler(~/^\/remotes/,rem.httpHandler)   

** Flow Module

   Publish/subscribe with session management, channel security. Currently a Push
   implementation.

** Data Module

   There is a database component with, so far, one driver, Sqlite3. The api is
   asynchronous and NoSQL. It stores haXe serialized objects in Sqlite, yet
   provides a general indexing facility which utilises the underlying sqlite
   indexes. This does mean that there is no generalized query facility, haXe
   programs require to be written to extract the data.

   The Sqlite driver is a popular C++ module for Node.js supported by many of the
   leading names in the Node.js community. It's asynchronous and embedded in
   the node.js instance, thus data access is very fast.

   So, each Cloudshift instance has it's own database, this can be easily augmented
   so that each instance running talks to a central Cloudshift instance just
   running data services. Cloudshift provides a remote api compatible driver for
   this purpose. *The main point here is to think of the Node.js/Sqlite3
   combination as a database server in it's own right*

** Worker Module

   Extend Worker and create seamless sub process workers using the haXe remoting
   protocol.

** Sys Module
   File I/O, Process services wrapped in Outcomes as appropriate for this kind
   of usage:

    Sys.writeFile("woot","hi there")
      .onError(function(reason) {
          trace("Err is :"+reason);
        })
      .flatMap(function(file) {
            return file.stat();
        })
      .map(function(stat) {
          return stat.path;
        })
      .flatMap(function(path) {
          return path.rename("niceone");
        })
      .deliver(function(newFileName) {
          trace("cool "+newFileName);
              
          var p = Sys.events();
        
          p.observe(function(o) {
              switch(o) {
              case ProcessUncaughtException(ex):
                trace("uuncauthg exp:"+ex);
              default:
              }
            });

          trace(Sys.argv());
          trace(Sys.title());
          trace("osuptime:"+Sys.osUptime()+", uptime:"+Sys.uptime());
          
          
          Sys.stdout().write("nice one laddie");
          
          Sys.spawn("ls").deliver(function(child) {
              child.stdout.observe(function(e) {
                  switch(e) {
                  case Data(s):
                    trace(s);
                  default:
                  }
                });
            });

          Sys.execFile("ls").deliver(function(output) {
                trace(output);              
            });
        });



** Dependencies

   Cloudshift relies on the raw Node.js haXe externs found here,

   http://github.com/cloudshift/hx-node
   
   Also Formidable the Node.js POST handler
   
   npm install formidable
   
   and for the Data module
   
   npm install sqlite3

* Installation

  install node.js for your platform
  
  npm install formidable
  npm install sqlite3   // may not be available on windows
  haxelib install cloudshift
  
* Usage

  Check http://github.com/cloudshift/cloudshift-usage
